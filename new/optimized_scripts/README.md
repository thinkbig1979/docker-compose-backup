## Overview

This collection provides a comprehensive, production-ready backup solution for Docker compose stacks with critical reliability improvements and configuration enhancements. All scripts have been optimized based on detailed analysis to address security, reliability, and maintainability issues.

## Critical Fixes Applied

### üîß **Priority 1 - Critical Reliability Fixes**

1. **Fixed Double Timeout Issue** in `docker-backup.sh`
   - **Problem:** Nested timeouts causing premature container termination
   - **Solution:** Single timeout with enhanced container state verification
   - **Impact:** Prevents data corruption during container shutdown

2. **Enhanced Container Management**

AUTO_PRUNE=true
KEEP_DAILY=14
```

### 3. Configure Rclone (if using)

Edit `rclone.conf`:
```bash
SOURCE_DIR=/home/backup/resticbackup
REMOTE_NAME=your-rclone-remote
BACKUP_PATH=/backup/path
TRANSFERS=4
```

### 4. Select Directories for Backup

```bash
# Interactive directory selection
./manage-dirlist.sh
```

### 5. Run Backup

```bash
# Test run first
./docker-backup.sh --dry-run --verbose

# Full backup
./docker-backup.sh --verbose
```

   - Verify container dependencies
   - Review container logs for shutdown issues

2. **Backup Fails**
   - Verify RESTIC_REPOSITORY accessibility
   - Check disk space on backup destination
   - Review backup logs for specific errors

3. **Configuration Errors**
   - Validate all required fields in backup.conf
   - Check file permissions on configuration files
   - Verify directory paths exist and are accessible

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting
./docker-backup.sh --verbose --dry-run
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# View recent backup logs
tail -f logs/docker_backup.log

# Search for errors
grep ERROR logs/docker_backup.log
```

## Performance Optimization
