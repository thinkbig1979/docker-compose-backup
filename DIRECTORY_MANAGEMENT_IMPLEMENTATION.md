- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning even with partial failures

## File Interactions

### Configuration Files
- **backup.conf**: Source of `BACKUP_DIR` configuration
- **dirlist**: Primary directory configuration file (format: `directory=true|false`)
- **Templates**: Optional template files in `templates/` directory
- **Exports**: Generated export files for settings portability

### Integration with Backup System
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing docker-backup.sh script
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced Features**: Adds comprehensive management without disrupting workflows
- **Performance**: Optimized to handle large numbers of directories efficiently

## Usage Workflows

### Basic Directory Management
1. Access via Main Menu → "Directory List Management"
